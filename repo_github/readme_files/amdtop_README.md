AMDTOP
=====
(This project is forked from the NVTOP from Syllo which provide most of the component.)
What is NVTOP?
--------------

NVTOP stands for Neat Videocard TOP, a (h)top like task monitor for GPUs and
accelerators. It can handle multiple GPUs and print information about them in a
htop-familiar way.

Currently supported vendors are AMD (Linux amdgpu driver), Apple (limited M1 &
M2 support), Huawei (Ascend), Intel (Linux i915/Xe drivers), NVIDIA (Linux
proprietary divers), Qualcomm Adreno (Linux MSM driver), Broadcom VideoCore (Linux v3d driver).

Because a picture is worth a thousand words:

🌟KEY Improvement & Why choosing AMDTOP?
---------------

Original nvtop do qutie well with nvidia card. However, some important feature like junction temperature and VRAM temperature hadn't been provided, while the RX and TX is not usable for AMD cards, which has been abondoned in newly-released AMD drive version. Moreover, the pcie monitor could had problem since amd drive's feedback information is not correct. The most accurate and reliable way is to check the systemtical information. Two pictures are shown below to compare the difference on amd gpu.
⚠️For better monitor on pcie, a sudo is needed, or else it would fall back to traitional fetching method like nvtop, which could provide misleading information.

-----------------

It has to be pointed out that the modified version had and only had tested on AMD GPU with following models: Radeon Pro W7900, Radeon RX7900XTX and Radeon RX590. Other models of cards hadn't been tested, if you had met any issues, feel free to leave at the _Issues_.

NVTOP Options and Interactive Commands
--------------------------------------
### Interactive Setup Window

NVTOP has a builtin setup utility that provides a way to specialize the interface to your needs.
Simply press ``F2`` and select the options that are the best for you.

### Saving Preferences

You can save the preferences set in the setup window by pressing ``F12``.
The preferences will be loaded the next time you run ``amdtop``.

### AMDTOP Manual and Command line Options

AMDTOP comes with a manpage!
```bash
man amdtop
```
For quick command line arguments help
```bash
amdtop -h
amdtop --help
amdtop -v
amdtop --version
```
⚠️A system linkage or systemtical path should be modified or added to make sure it could be call out with such command.
⚠️Some GPU metrics (PCIe, per-process usage, temperatures) are read from ROCm SMI and kernel sysfs/debugfs, which may require elevated privileges; if you see N/A values, rerun with `sudo amdtop`.
-----------

### AMD

NVTOP supports AMD GPUs using the `amdgpu` driver through the exposed DRM and
sysfs interface.

AMD introduced the fdinfo interface in kernel 5.14 ([browse kernel
source](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tree/drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_fdinfo.c?h=linux-5.14.y)).
Hence, you will need a kernel with a version greater or equal to 5.14 to see the
processes using AMD GPUs.

Support for recent GPUs are regularly mainlined into the linux kernel, so please
use a recent-enough kernel for your GPU.

Build
-----

Several libraries are required in order for NVTOP to display GPU info:

* The *ncurses* library driving the user interface.
  * This makes the screen look beautiful.
* For NVIDIA: the *NVIDIA Management Library* (*NVML*) which comes with the GPU driver.
  * This queries the GPU for info.
* For AMD: the libdrm library used to query AMD GPUs through the kernel driver.
* For METAX: the *MetaX System Management Library* (*MXSML*) which comes with the GPU driver.
  * This queries the GPU for info.

## Distribution Specific Installation Process

### By Snapcraft

```bash
sudo snap install amdtop
```

### Other distribution is under development and coming soon...

## AMDTOP Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HUSRCF/amdtop.git
cmake -S amdtop -B amdtop/build -DAMDGPU_SUPPORT=ON -DROCM_SMI_SUPPORT=ON -DNVIDIA_SUPPORT=OFF -DINTEL_SUPPORT=OFF
cmake --build amdtop/build -j

# Install globally on the system
sudo cmake --install amdtop/build

# Alternatively, install without privileges at a location of your choosing
# cmake --install amdtop/build --prefix /path/to/your/dir
```

If you use **conda** as environment manager and encounter an error while building NVTOP, try `conda deactivate` before invoking `cmake`.

The build system supports multiple build types (e.g. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo):

* Release: Binary without debug info
* RelWithDebInfo: Binary with debug info
* Debug: Compile with warning flags and address/undefined sanitizers enabled (for development purposes)

Troubleshoot
------------

- The plot looks bad:
  - Verify that you installed the wide character version of the ncurses library (libncurses**w**5-dev for Debian / Ubuntu), clean the build directory and restart the build process.
- **Putty**: Tell putty not to lie about its capabilities (`$TERM`) by setting the field ``Terminal-type string`` to ``putty`` in the menu
  ``Connection > Data > Terminal Details``.
