# Unofficial 3WiFi Locator v2 for Android 

This is a new version of 3wifi locator, which is based on the version from drygdryg.

# Changelog

Descriptions and instructions for my added new functions can be found on the Wiki Github page: https://github.com/LowSkillDeveloper/3WiFiLocator-Unofficial/wiki

> [!NOTE]
> The changelog contains only information about the changes that I made myself in version of locator by drygdryg. The original drygdryg version repository has been removed.

## Added Features:
- Added ability to view saved passwords on your phone (root only)
- Added switch to enable search by ESSID on the scanning page.
- Added primitive validation for WPS PIN and password on the local database page.
- Added Connection via WPS button

  - Functionality to load server list from online sources (working mirrors or proxy servers).
- Display of 3WiFi API keys with the ability to copy them.
- Dark theme and option to switch to it.
