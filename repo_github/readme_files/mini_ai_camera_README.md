## Installing Requirements
Steps for setting up your raspberry pi!
You'll need to install a few things first...

### Update Pi if you haven't already
```commandline
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
```

## Picamera2
#### Picamera2 will already be install on the full desktop version
#### On systems where Picamera2 is supported but not pre-installed (Such as the Lite OS), you can install it with
```commandline
sudo apt install python3-picamera2
```
#### OR to get a slightly reduced installation with fewer of the window system related elements (USE THIS for installing on a Raspberry Pi OS Lite system)
```commandline
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends
```

## Other Requirements
### IMX500 (AI Camera)
```commandline
sudo apt install imx500-all
```
### picamera2 tells us to install system wide
### Therefore we need to install opencv etc, also at the system level...
### E.G.
```commandline
sudo apt install python3-opencv
```

## OS Lite!
### If you're using the Lite OS you will also need to install:
```commandline
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 --no-install-recommends
sudo apt install git
```

## Reboot Pi after install!

```commandline
sudo reboot now
```

# Git Clone the repo!
### If using the Lite OS first
```commandline
mkdir Documents
```
### then
```commandline
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/LukeDitria/mini_ai_camera.git
```

## Install pip requirements including system-wide packages (we need to use the system picamera2 install...)
```commandline
cd mini_ai_camera/
python -m venv venv --system-site-packages
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```

## Check file paths in data_logger.sh and data_logger.service are correct for you!!
### Activate script
```commandline
chmod +x data_logger.sh
```
### Test run!
```commandline
./data_logger.sh
```

## Creating a service
```commandline
sudo cp data_logger.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable data_logger.service
sudo systemctl start data_logger.service
```
 You can also use the "status", "stop" and "restart" commands!
```commandline
sudo systemctl status data_logger.service
sudo systemctl stop data_logger.service
sudo systemctl restart data_logger.service
```
It's a good idea to stop the service running if you are still setting up the Pi!


# Auto Mounting a USB Drive!
### If you are using the full desktop OS then ANY USB storage device will be automatically mounted in /media
### However, if you are using the OS Lite this will not happen and you will need to configure every USB device you want to use so it will auto mount when plugged in...
## 📂 Auto-Mounting a USB Drive by UUID

If you want your Raspberry Pi (or Linux system) to automatically mount a USB drive at boot, you can use its **UUID** in `/etc/fstab`. This ensures the correct drive is mounted every time, even if the device path (`/dev/sda1`, `/dev/sdb1`, etc.) changes.

### 1. Find the UUID of Your USB Drive
First, plug in your USB drive and find its partition (e.g /dev/sda1):
```commandline
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,MODEL,MOUNTPOINT
```
then find it's UUID (replace /dev/sda1 with your USB device partition)
```commandline
sudo blkid /dev/sda1
```

 You'll see something like:
```bash
/dev/sda1: UUID="17F8-3814" BLOCK_SIZE="512" TYPE="vfat"
```
Note down the UUID and TYPE

### Create a mount point
```commandline
sudo mkdir -p /media/pi/myusb
sudo chown -R pi:pi /media/pi/myusb/
```

### Edit /etc/fstab to include your device
```commandline
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Add this line at the end using YOUR UUID and TYPE!!

```commandline
UUID=17F8-3814  /media/pi/myusb  vfat  defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=000  0  0
```
You may need to run 
```commandline
systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Testing that it works
```commandline
sudo mount -a
df -h
```
You should see a line like
```commandline
/dev/sda1       115G  140M  115G   1% /media/pi/myusb
```

### Reboot!
Reboot your Pi and then run 
```commandline
df -h
```
To see if it has mounted automatically!
