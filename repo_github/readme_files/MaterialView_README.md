# MaterialView

A customizable macOS material blur view that goes beyond `NSVisualEffectView`.

For a deep dive into the internals, see [Reverse Engineering NSVisualEffectView](https://oskargroth.com/blog/reverse-engineering-nsvisualeffectview).

## Features

- **Full control** over blur radius, saturation, brightness, and tint colors
- **State-aware materials** with active, inactive, emphasized, and accessibility configurations
- **Blend groups** for seamless material continuity across multiple views
- **Behind-window blending** to sample content from the desktop and other apps
- **SwiftUI and AppKit** support

## Demo App

The repository includes a demo app for experimenting with effect configurations in real time. Open `Demo/MaterialDemo.xcodeproj` to try it out.

## Installation

Add MaterialView to your project using Swift Package Manager:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/OskarGroth/MaterialView.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Usage

### SwiftUI

```swift
import MaterialView

MaterialView(effect: .panelDark, cornerRadius: 12)
    .frame(width: 300, height: 200)
```

### AppKit

```swift
import MaterialView

let materialView = NSMaterialView()
materialView.effect = .panelDark
materialView.cornerRadius = 12
```

### Custom Effects

Create your own materials with full control over the appearance:

```swift
let customEffect = NSMaterialView.Effect(
    active: .MaterialStyle(
        backgroundColor: NSColor(white: 0.15, alpha: 0.5),
        tintColor: NSColor(white: 0.1, alpha: 0.3),
        tintFilter: kCAFilterLightenBlendMode,
        saturationFactor: 1.8,
        brightnessFactor: 0.02,
        blurRadius: 30
    ),
    rimColor: (inner: .white.withAlphaComponent(0.15), outer: .clear),
    rimWidth: (inner: 1, outer: 0)
)
```

## Notes

MaterialView relies on undocumented CoreAnimation classes (`CABackdropLayer`, `CAFilter`) and private window properties. While these APIs have been stable for years and are used extensively by Apple's own frameworks, they could change in future macOS releases.
